# Autonomous Repository Policy

Scheduled repository window: **Sunday 05:00 UTC**, with a 2.5-hour allocation before the next repository starts.

All changes from humans, Renovate, autofix.ci, KiloConnect/Kilo Code, RAMS/OpenRouter or future Council automation must use a pull request and pass this repository's required CI/security/deployment gates.

Kilo may diagnose and prepare code/configuration fixes, including dependency-manifest and lockfile corrections such as `package.json` changes when evidence shows they are required to complete a PR. Kilo must not merge directly to protected branches or deploy directly to production.

## Guardrails
- GREEN: deterministic formatter/lint/import/generated-file repairs may be automated.
- AMBER: application code, dependency compatibility, build/deployment configuration and ordinary bug fixes may be prepared automatically as PRs.
- RED: automation must not weaken CodeQL, Trivy, Gitleaks, tests, coverage thresholds, required checks, branch/ruleset protections, workflow permissions, secret handling, security allowlists or production access merely to obtain a green result.
- Security-scanner failures are excluded from automatic Kilo invocation and remain independent evidence-led gates.
- Failed autonomous repairs must return through the complete repository CI/security/deployment path.

## PR lifecycle
GitHub is authoritative for PR state. Mergify housekeeping is permitted only from explicit lifecycle labels:
- `autonomy:superseded`
- `autonomy:obsolete`
- `autonomy:human-hold`

Never close a PR solely because of age. The future HIVE Repository Council will reconcile lineage and R2 history.
