# Autonomous Repository Policy

Scheduled repository window: **Sunday 05:00 UTC**, with a 2.5-hour allocation before the next repository starts.

All changes from humans, Renovate, autofix.ci, KiloConnect/Kilo Code, RAMS/OpenRouter or future Council automation must use a pull request and pass this repository's required CI/security/deployment gates.

Kilo may diagnose and prepare code/configuration fixes, including dependency-manifest and lockfile corrections such as `package.json` changes when evidence shows they are required to complete a PR. Kilo must not merge directly to protected branches or deploy directly to production.

## Guardrails
- GREEN: deterministic formatter/lint/import/generated-file repairs may be automated.
- AMBER: application code, dependency compatibility, build/deployment configuration and ordinary bug fixes may be prepared automatically as PRs.
- RED: automation must not weaken CodeQL, Trivy, Gitleaks, tests, coverage thresholds, required checks, branch/ruleset protections, workflow permissions, secret handling, security allowlists or production access merely to obtain a green result.
- Security-scanner decisions remain independent evidence-led gates. CodeQL/repository-security failures may invoke Kilo for code repair, but alert dismissal, suppressions, allowlist changes and security-policy decisions remain human-controlled.
- Failed autonomous repairs must return through the complete repository CI/security/deployment path.

## PR lifecycle
GitHub is authoritative for PR state. Mergify housekeeping is permitted only from explicit lifecycle labels:
- `autonomy:superseded`
- `autonomy:obsolete`
- `autonomy:human-hold`

Never close a PR solely because of age. The future HIVE Repository Council will reconcile lineage and R2 history.

## Main-branch repair PR loop

If an ordinary CI, CodeQL/security or deployment-verification workflow fails on the default branch, `.github/workflows/autonomous-repair.yml` creates one deduplicated repair **carrier PR** rather than an issue. The carrier contains an unresolved marker under `.autonomy/repair-requests/` and asks `@kilocode-bot` to diagnose and implement the smallest safe correction in PR context.

Kilo GitHub implementation mode may update the carrier branch or create its own implementation branch/PR. If it updates the carrier, the marker is removed only after the underlying defect is fixed. If Kilo opens a separate implementation PR, the carrier marker stays as lifecycle evidence and a successful default-branch rerun marks the carrier obsolete. This prevents an evidence-only carrier from being mistaken for a completed repair.

Minor/digest/patch dependency automation remains owned by the committed Renovate policy. Kilo is the repair path for repository/code/configuration defects exposed by CI; it does not replace the independent CI/security gates.

Autonomous repair PRs are created with the dedicated Autonomy Repair GitHub App installation token. Configure the repository variable `AUTONOMY_REPAIR_APP_ID` and the private-key secret referenced by `.github/workflows/autonomous-repair.yml`. Branch/ruleset protections and required checks remain authoritative.

## Trusted PR creator

The autonomous repair workflow must use the dedicated Autonomy Repair GitHub App installation token rather than `GITHUB_TOKEN`. GitHub deliberately requires manual approval for pull-request workflows created or updated by `GITHUB_TOKEN`; App-created PRs avoid that manual approval path while retaining the repository's normal checks.

The repair App receives only the repository permissions needed to create repair branches/PRs and lifecycle labels. It does not receive direct merge or deployment authority.

Successful default-branch reruns automatically mark open repair PRs for the same workflow as `autonomy:obsolete` (unless they are on human hold), allowing Mergify to close stale repair carriers safely. This prevents a Kilo-created replacement PR or a manual correction from leaving the original repair PR behind.
## CodeQL and security handoff

- CodeQL has an explicit open-alert gate: open CodeQL alerts on the current main ref or same-repository pull request fail the CodeQL workflow instead of remaining a green-but-alerting scan.
- Main-branch CodeQL or repository-security failures enter the same carrier lifecycle and are labelled `autonomy:security-repair`.
- If CodeQL/security fails on a trusted autonomous carrier or Kilo implementation PR, the workflow re-invokes `@kilocode-bot` from that PR context. Kilo may update the current branch when its integration supports that, or create one linked replacement implementation PR; repeated unbounded PR chains are not acceptable.
- Kilo may repair code/configuration, but it must not dismiss CodeQL alerts, weaken queries/tests, broaden suppressions, change secret allowlists or make security-policy decisions. If no safe repository code change is justified, the carrier marker stays and the work moves to `autonomy:human-hold`.
