# Kilo Code Review Guidance

Review pull requests for correctness, regressions, dependency/build consistency, security, tests and deployment safety.

For small dependency or code changes, prioritise concrete blockers over stylistic preferences. `package.json`, lockfiles, Python requirement inputs/locks and deployment configuration may be changed when required by the implementation.

For PRs labelled `autonomy:repair`, the file under `.autonomy/repair-requests/` is a deliberate unresolved marker. The repair is not complete while that marker remains. Verify that the underlying failure is genuinely fixed before accepting removal of the marker.

Carrier PRs authored by `autonomous-repair-bot[bot]` and titled `[autonomy] Repair ...` are evidence only. Never recommend merging a carrier PR; the fix belongs in a separate linked implementation PR. Close the carrier as obsolete after a successful default-branch rerun. If a carrier marker was already merged into `main`, remove only that misplaced file in a reviewed cleanup PR while keeping the failed run and carrier PR history.

Never recommend weakening CodeQL, Trivy, Gitleaks, tests, required checks, branch/ruleset protections, workflow permissions, secret handling or security policy merely to obtain a green result. Do not recommend broad suppressions or allowlists for unexplained findings.

The target repository's CI/security/deployment checks are authoritative regardless of whether the change originated from Kilo, Renovate, RAMS, another bot or a human.

Describe each actionable finding with a named file, line or package and the concrete failure. The PR repair router uses those details to distinguish a repairable issue from general review commentary.
